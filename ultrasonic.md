Challenge = Ultrasonic RFID
Flag = RWSC{YOUGOTIT}

Method: 

There is a ultrasonic sensor and RFID connected to Adruino in the room. After reading through the question, we thought that in order to get the key to display, the ultrasonic sensor must not receive any signals, so we tried blocking the sensor. 

After some struggling with the sensor, the flag is generated on the display suddenly when we are walking around the sensor. We then try positioning ourselves on different distance with the sensor, and after some attempts, when we position ourselves 90cm with the sensor, the flag is shown on the display.
